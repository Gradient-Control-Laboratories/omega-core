// Displacement for the GSL raymarch viewers (webdm, webai, webedit).
//
// The third row of a material record carries a signed height in millimetres
// (`material.withDisplacement`). The renderer marches the displaced field,
//
//     d'(p) = d(p) - h(p)
//
// so the surface genuinely moves: silhouettes follow the relief, the ambient
// occlusion loop sees it, refraction through displaced glass bends on it, and
// the shading normal comes out as grad(d) - grad(h) from the usual central
// differences, with no separate bump term. Positive height pushes the surface
// outward.
//
// This is a render-only finish. The mesher, the client compute mesher and
// every export path keep evaluating the undisplaced sdShape, so what is
// manufactured does not change. Relief that should be manufactured is a
// geometry operation instead: `ball - 0.3 * noise.cellularEdges(1.5)`.
//
// Subtracting a height field breaks the Lipschitz bound, which the march
// already handles: it divides each step by the magnitude of the field's
// tetrahedral gradient, clamped at 1, so the step shrinks exactly where the
// height is steep. Every call site in the render path is rewritten from
// sdShape to gsl_sdDisplaced, which keeps that correction, the nearest-
// crossing comparison and the hit epsilons untouched.
//
// Cost: one material-field evaluation per field evaluation, and the march
// takes five per step (the sample plus the four gradient taps). The material
// field the compiler emits hoists every return's height expression to the top
// of its body, so a noise-driven height is paid in full on each of them. The
// fix is a codegen change, a gsl_heightField that lowers only the third row
// for the winning index.
//
// Displacement is on for every document with a material field. It used to be
// on only when the field referenced its position, which kept preset-only
// documents off this path but also dropped a constant non-zero height:
// material.withDisplacement(m, 0.5) inflated nothing. A constant record's
// lookup is a branch and a constant, so the preset documents that shortcut
// protected pay little for being included.

// The displacement scale, as a per-invocation private var rather than a
// parameter: gsl_sdDisplaced has to stand in for sdShape at call sites that
// cannot grow an argument. Follows the gsl_pw / gsl_fieldFilterIdx pattern
// already in the viewers. The render path sets it from the surface knobs at
// fragment entry; 0 marches the undisplaced field.

// program's compile time grows with the number of copies. The winning shape's
