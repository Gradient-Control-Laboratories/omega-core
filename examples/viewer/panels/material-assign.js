// would write by hand, so the choice survives a reload, shows up in the diff,
// and composes with everything else the material libraries do. Nothing here
// touches the renderer.
//
// The two annotation kinds are written differently, and the difference is the
// one common/program/annotation draws. An @material returns a record AND the
// albedo that goes with it, so it is destructured and sets both properties. An
// @finish carries no colour on purpose, so it sets .material alone and leaves
// whatever colour the body already had — which is the whole point of a finish:
// it is meant to be paired with a colour from somewhere else.
//
// This module is a pure string -> string function, the way mesh-import.js's
// placeMeshInSource is, so the whole contract is testable without a browser.
